"""``hops fg embed``: a searchable embedding group over a feature group's text column.

``hops fg embed SOURCE --text COL`` makes or updates the group's Python job
``GROUP_embed``, then the group itself when it needs a new version: fenced,
with that job as its only writer. It starts one execution of the job; the build
runs there (``embed_run``), never in the caller. ``hops fg embed delete GROUP``
runs the job's deletion execution, which fences and deletes the groups, then
deletes the job. ``delete`` is the only subcommand, so any other first word is
the source feature group.

    This command makes the embedding group and its Python job GROUP_embed,
    starts one execution, prints its id and returns; it does not wait. Read
    the job's state with `hops job info GROUP_embed` and its log with
    `hops job logs`. A start the platform refuses for capacity exits non-zero
    and starts nothing: run it again after the time it names.

    Each row's text is cut into chunks of --chunk-chars characters that
    overlap by --chunk-overlap; each chunk is a row keyed by (doc_id,
    chunk_ix), doc_id being the source row's primary key, with its text,
    embedding (cosine), content_sha and embedded_at. The model and dimension
    are in the group's description; another model or dimension makes a new
    version. A rerun embeds only changed chunks and deletes the chunks of
    shortened or deleted rows, from both stores. A failed source read changes
    nothing. A source over the supported input (50,000 chunks and 100 MB of
    text unless an admin granted more) is refused with nothing written.

    Only the group's job writes the group, one execution at a time: each run
    takes the group over from every older run, so a stopped or stuck run never
    writes over a newer one.

    The embedding deployment is called with your own credentials. Search it
    from an agent with `hops agent init NAME --reads ... --search GROUP`.
    `hops fg embed delete GROUP` removes the group, its job and its schedule.
